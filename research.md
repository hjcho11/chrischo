My research explores how agents can be morally responsible in a world shaped by manipulation and determinism.

### Towards Agent Modalist Reasons-Sensitivity  
*Forthcoming in Philosophical Quarterly*  
This paper defends a revived form of agent modalism that excludes agent-altering events from relevant alternatives, allowing agents to be reasons-sensitive without relying on mechanisms.

### Hard-Line Structuralism and Degrees  
This work develops a novel compatibilist framework in which moral responsibility scales with the structure of agency rather than its causal history.
