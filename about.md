Hello! I’m **Chris Cho**, a PhD student in Philosophy at Syracuse University.

My research focuses on free will, moral responsibility, and metaphysics of agency. I’m especially interested in compatibilist-friendly solutions to manipulation arguments and the role of agential structures in grounding moral responsibility.

This website contains:
